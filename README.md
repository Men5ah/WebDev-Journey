# WebDev-Journey
This repo explores my journey into web development.

#What will I be doing?
Thanks for asking, I will be using Free Code Camp's responsive web design certification to learn about web development with HTML and CSS. Once I'm done with that, I will look into their Javascript certification as well. I will then round off with the front end and back end certifications, from Free Code Camp as well. I believe that after all those, I should be confident enough to build a whole, interactive website of my own.
